## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

BIMTypeCode is type coding made simple. With an easy-to-understand coding structure based on planning requirements, Danish building practice and experience from complex to simple BIM projects. The structure of *BIMTypeCode DK:2022* is a further development of the BIM7AA Typecode, which is based on the SfB system.

BIMTypeCode has been prepared by the BIM grassroots in [BIM7AA](http://bim7aa.dk) in collaboration with our Danish engineering network and [BIM Stockholm](http://bimstockholm.se).

The codes can be found here, or on the [BIMTypeCode](https://bimtypecode.github.io/da/index.html) website.
